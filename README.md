# TiesInRankBasedTests

This repository contains code used for simulations in a recent manuscript submission. The code is also posted. 

Sub-repositories:
csv-files contains data generated by runs of the various code modules. Each .csv file is labeled with the type of tie-adjustment (Omit = omission, Jitt=jittering, MR = mid-ranks, and AS = average-scores) and the percentage of ties in the data.

RCode: Contains R code for generating  the csv-files. Unfortunately, I did not set the seed for any of the random number generators. Therefore, if you run this code, you will not be able to reproduce the work exactly. 

Figures: Contains R code for importing data into R, tidying the data, and generating graphics

If you use the code or data for your own purposes, please cite this repository as the source.

The manuscript will be uploaded when it is accepted for publication.
