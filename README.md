# TiesInRankBasedTests

This repository contains code used for simulations in a recent manuscript submission. The code is also posted. 

Types of Files:
.csv files contain data generated by runs of the various code modules
.txt files contain R code for generating the data

Unfortunately, I did not set the seed for any of the random number generators. Therefore, if you run this code, you will not be able to reproduce the work exactly. 

If you use the code or data for your own purposes, please cite this repository as the source.

The manuscript will be uploaded to the repository when it is accepted for publication.
